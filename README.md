# ParentTeacherMobileApplication
Parent-Teacher Conference Mobile Application developed in May 2018 for my Senior Project, titled Lets Meet.

Mobile application is designed with a clean user interface to send SMS with the teacher's message that generates a link for the parent to set up an appointment with the teacher for a meeting.
Once the parent confirms the date and time, the teacher will be notified on the application and can see all confirmed appoitnments.

Software: Android Studio SDK
Programming Langues: Java, MySQL, PHP, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
